Notebooks for the manuscript [*Optimization of AsCas12a for combinatorial genetic screens in human cells*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0600-6).
Notebooks are organized into sections which correspond to those in the manuscript. The machine learning model 
to increase guide efficacy relies on the package [sgrna_modeler](https://github.com/PeterDeWeirdt/sgrna_modeler), a 
version of which is zipped here. The apoptosis combinatorial library was analyzed with the package 
[intactr](https://github.com/PeterDeWeirdt/intactr).
